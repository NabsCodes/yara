# Yara

Yara is a project born out of a design crafted during my time at Perxcel Design UI/UX School. This repository contains the codebase for Yara, developed to bring the design to life.

## Project Setup

The project utilizes Vite and React, providing a minimal setup that includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a set of ESLint rules for code quality.

### Official Plugins Used

To enhance the development experience, Yara employs two official Vite plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Integrates Babel for Fast Refresh, ensuring a seamless development experience by enabling instant feedback on code changes.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Leverages SWC for Fast Refresh, offering a high-performance alternative to Babel with faster build times.

## Getting Started

To get started with developing Yara, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

Enjoy building with Yara and bring your UI/UX designs to life!
